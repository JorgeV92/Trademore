# Trademore

Welcome to Trademore, a project dedicated to the study and implementation of various trading methods and mathematical finance models using OCaml. This project aims to explore the intersection of finance and functional programming, starting with the implementation of the Simple Moving Average and the Black-Scholes model.

## Introduction

 The project focuses on clarity, performance, and practical examples to demonstrate key concepts in trading.

## Features

- **Simple Moving Average (SMA):** Implementation and analysis of SMA to understand market trends.
- **Black-Scholes Model:** Coding the Black-Scholes formula in OCaml to price European options and study their behavior.
- **Functional Programming in OCaml:** Utilize the powerful features of OCaml to implement financial models efficiently and effectively.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **OCaml:** Ensure you have OCaml installed on your system. You can install it from [OCaml's official website](https://ocaml.org).
- **OPAM:** OCaml package manager to install required libraries. Installation instructions can be found at [opam.ocaml.org](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html).
